# Nix Cache Worker

![Nix Cache Worker admin console](docs/assets/admin-page.png)

Nix Cache Worker is a Cloudflare Worker that provides a standard HTTP binary
cache for Nix, backed by Cloudflare R2 and D1. It is designed for CI systems
that build packages and publish them to a private, policy-managed cache.

It supports:

- standard `nix copy --to` and `nix copy --from` workflows;
- public cache reads with authenticated writes;
- package and build-version organization with tags;
- retention policies, pins, and bounded garbage collection;
- an authenticated web console for operations and administration.

## Quick start

Install dependencies and create your private deployment configuration from the
checked-in template:

```bash
npm install
cp wrangler.jsonc.example wrangler.jsonc
```

Edit `wrangler.jsonc` with your R2 bucket, D1 database, hostname, and public
signing key. The file is ignored by Git. Then authenticate Wrangler, apply the
schema, configure Worker Secrets, and deploy:

```bash
npx wrangler login
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply <D1_DATABASE_NAME> --remote
npx wrangler secret put READ_TOKEN
npx wrangler secret put WRITE_TOKEN
npx wrangler secret put ADMIN_TOKEN
npx wrangler deploy
```

See [`docs/deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md) for resource setup, custom
domains, signing, verification, and upgrade guidance.

## Using the cache

Reads are public by default. Nix publishers use the Worker write token through
a mode-0600 netrc entry, while management operations use the admin token. The
public home page shows the NixOS and nix-darwin client configuration example
for the deployed origin.

The admin console is available at `/admin`. It manages package versions,
retention rules, pins, garbage collection, and persistent deletion jobs.

## Development

For local-only secrets, copy the example file instead of committing values:

```bash
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
npm run dev
```

Run the checks with:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

`npm run build` performs a Wrangler dry run; it does not deploy the Worker.

  retention, observability, and acceptance criteria.
- [Deployment guide](docs/deployment.md) — Cloudflare resources, migrations,
  secrets, custom domains, and verification.

R2 is the source of truth for cache bytes, D1 stores indexes and lifecycle
metadata, and Worker Secrets are the only source of bearer-token values.
