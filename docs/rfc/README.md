# RFC process

This directory is the durable design record for Nix Cache Worker. Every
future change that affects public behavior, HTTP compatibility, authentication,
storage, schema, artifact-set semantics, retention, garbage collection,
deployment, or security must have a numbered RFC in this directory.

## Required workflow

1. Add the next available `RFC-NNNN-<short-name>.md` before implementing the
   change.
2. Describe the problem, scope, proposed design, invariants, compatibility and
   security impact, migration plan, and acceptance tests.
3. Set the status to `Proposed` while the design is being reviewed.
4. Update the status to `Accepted` when implementation begins, and record the
   implementation result and any deviations before marking the work complete.

Pure spelling, formatting, and comment-only changes do not require a new RFC.
If a change is intentionally reverted, update the RFC that introduced it or
add a short superseding RFC; do not silently erase the design history.
